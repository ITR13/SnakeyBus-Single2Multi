# SnakeyBus - Single To Multi

A MelonLoader mod that allows you to play Singleplayer maps in Multiplayer.  
Created by ITR with help by LTR.



## Installation

To use this mod, first install MelonLoader version 6.1 or 6.3 and higher. [Click Here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements) for install instructions for MelonLoader.  

After running the game with MelonLoader once and verifying it runs, find the "Mods" folder generated inside the game directory (It's in the same folder snakeybus.exe is in). Download [Single2Multi.dll](https://github.com/ITR13/SnakeyBus-Single2Multi/releases/download/1.0.0/Single2Multi.dll) and place it in that folder.

Head over to multiplayer and go to the room creation screen. If everything was installed correctly, you should now see the single player maps in the list of maps.

## Usage
The person creating a room just has to select one of the singleplayer maps and create a room normally.

To ensure that people without the mod won't accidentally join modded lobbies, the room will be hidden from the "Find A Game" list if you use a singleplayer map. Instead the person joining has to enter the room name into the "Room #" field on top, and press "Join Game".
